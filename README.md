A plugin is a software add-on that is installed on a program, enhancing its capabilities. For example, if you wanted to watch a video on a website, you may need a plugin to do so. If the plugin is not installed, your browser will not understand how to play the video.
Every web browser has an official website where you can download and install plugins (also called "add-ons" or "extensions"). The web browser publisher (e.g., Google, Mozilla, Apple, etc.) verifies the plugins are not harmful before making them available to download.
